# CareSphere
This is a healthcare management system currently under development (this repository is supposed to streamline our workflow). It aims to provide seamless interaction among doctors, hospitals/clinics, their management and staff, and patients. We intend to write the codes in C++. File operations will be used to maintain a database in the background. Qt will be used to build the GUI. 
This started as a project proposal for our OOP-4302 lab.
