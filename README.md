# CareSphere
This is a healthcare management system developed using C++, MySQL (some file operations) & Qt. C++ was the primary language used to develop this project. MySQL retains the database in the background. Qt was used to create the GUI. A more expanded suite of functionalities has been added to the CLI version of this project. The GUI side can provide a convenient app for the patients to handle their medical necessities. At the same time, the CLI version is equipped for more advanced services including for doctors & hospital administrations.
This started as a project submission idea for our OOP-4302 lab. As a result, further improvements are expected.
